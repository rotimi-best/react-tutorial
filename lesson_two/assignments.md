2. When I click on the button, the side navigation should disappear, and when I click it again, it should appear. See the code [here](https://jsfiddle.net/alcidesqueiroz/zwrpna7u/). Everything has already being developed all you need to do is to add a condition to remove the navigation when the button is clicked and vice versa.

3. Use the code in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/RB_Projects/pen/bGGWdPg). Loop through the array of pets in your `<App />` component and pass them as props to the `<Pet />` component. In the `<Pet />` component, check if `isDog` value, if it is true then show the `<Dog />` else `<Cat />`. Make sure you pass the required props to each child component.

4. From question 3, in the `<App />` component, add 3 buttons, the first button `<button>Only Dogs</button>` if clicked will show only dogs, the second button `<button>Only Cats</button>` if clicked will show only cats and the third button `<button>All Pets</button>` if clicked will show all pets.

5. Follow the instructions in this [codepen](https://codepen.io/RB_Projects/pen/eYYWpyx)
